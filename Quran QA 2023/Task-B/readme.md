# Quran QA 2023 shared task B participation

Use the `TCE QQA2023-B demo notebook.ipynb` file to get an overview of:
1. installation
2. data download
3. faithful data generation
4. pre-training data generation
5. training and fine-tuning of a LM
6. downloading and obtaining a dump file
7. 
🎉 All models can be found on my [huggingface account](https://huggingface.co/MatMulMan)

**Once the training is made you will find a dump file saved!**

Something like: bert-base-arabertv02-fine-tuned-2e-05-first-827-QQA23_TaskB_qrcd_v1.2_train.zip
This is a bert-base-arabertv02 fine-tuned model with:
1. learning rate of 2e-05. 
2. first learning method.
3. A random starting seed of 827.
4. QQA23_TaskB_qrcd_v1.2_train training data is used

This dump file contains all summary results and model predictions for each sample. 
You can look at the **analysis** directory of the repo for more details.
You can group dump files into folders:
1. run **performance_analysis.py** script
2. Then run **ensemble_analysis.py** to get ensemble results from the **performance_analysis.py** script results.
3. run **generate_reports.py**  to get excel aggregated results and kernel density plots for different runs.
